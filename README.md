# SVM-Multithreading
The objective of this project is to optimize the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for a multi-class dataset from the UCI library, specifically the abalone dataset, using Python. The dataset size must have rows between 5k and 30k and is divided into 70-30 for training and testing. 20 and 40 different samples are used to optimize the SVM for every sample with 100 iterations. The best parameters are reported in Table 1. To reduce the time of parameter optimization, multithreading is applied. Finally, a table is created to compare the accuracy with 1, 2, 3, and 4 threads. The results of this project can be useful for future work in optimizing SVM for multi-class datasets.
