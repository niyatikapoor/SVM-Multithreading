# SVM-Multithreading
This project aimed to optimize Support Vector Machines (SVM) using multithreading to classify abalone species from a multi-class dataset obtained from the UCI library. The dataset was divided into a 70-30 ratio for training and testing with 20 and 40 samples, respectively. SVM was optimized for each sample with 100 iterations. Multithreading was applied to reduce the time taken for parameter optimization. A table was constructed to compare the accuracy of the SVM with 1, 2, 3, and 4 threads. The results showed that using multiple threads reduced the time taken for parameter optimization, and the accuracy of SVM increased with more threads. This project demonstrates the use of multithreading to improve the efficiency of machine learning algorithms, specifically SVM, and its effectiveness in solving multi-class classification problems.
